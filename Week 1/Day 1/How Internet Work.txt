How Internet Work?
1. Devices connect to a network
    Your phone, laptop, or computer connects to the internet using:
    Wi-Fi (via a router)
    Mobile data (via cell towers)
    Wired connection (Ethernet cable)

2. Router & ISP (Internet Service Provider)
    Your device sends requests to your router.
    The router forwards your request to your ISP (like Airtel, Jio, BSNL, etc. in India).
    The ISP gives you access to the global internet.

3. IP Address
    Every device on the internet has a unique identifier called an IP address (like a phone number for devices).
    Your ISP assigns you an IP address so that websites and other devices know where to send information.

4. DNS (Domain Name System)
    You type www.google.com into your browser.
    Computers don’t understand names, they understand IP addresses.
    DNS works like a phonebook, converting the website name into the website’s IP address (e.g., 142.250.190.14).

5. Data travels in packets
    Your request (“open google.com”) is broken into tiny data packets.
    These packets travel through cables, satellites, undersea fiber optic lines, and networks across the world.
    They find the fastest route to reach the destination (like traffic navigation).

6. Servers respond
    The server where the website is hosted receives your request.
    It processes it and sends back the website data (also in packets).

7. Reassembling & Display
    Your browser collects all the packets, reassembles them, and displays the website for you.

This all happens in milliseconds!

✅ In short:
Your device → Router → ISP → DNS → Internet backbone → Website server → Back to you.

What is MAC Address?
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC). It’s used for communication within a local network (LAN).
🔑 Key points about MAC address:
    Format: Usually 12 hexadecimal characters (0–9, A–F), written in pairs, e.g.
    00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E or 00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E
    Each network device (Wi-Fi card, Ethernet port, Bluetooth adapter) has its own MAC.
    It works at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
    Unlike IP addresses (which can change), MAC addresses are generally permanent to the hardware (though they can  be spoofed).

History of Web
1. Before the Web (1960s–1980s)    
    The idea of computer networking started in the 1960s with ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, 1969).
    ARPANET connected universities and research institutions, allowing them to exchange data.
    Protocols like TCP/IP (1983) became the foundation for the modern Internet.

2. Birth of the World Wide Web (1989–1993)
    In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN, proposed the World Wide Web as a system to share documents using hyperlinks.
    He created:
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) → for creating web pages.
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) → for communication.
    URL (Uniform Resource Locator) → for addressing resources.
    In 1991, the first website went live.
    By 1993, the first graphical browser, Mosaic, made the web user-friendly.

3. Web 1.0 (1990s – early 2000s)
    Mostly static websites (read-only).
    Content was created by a few people, and users were mainly readers.
    Examples: early Yahoo!, GeoCities, Netscape.

4. Web 2.0 (2004 – present)
    Transition to interactive, user-generated content.
    Rise of blogs, wikis, and especially social media (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter).
    Richer web apps using JavaScript, AJAX, and dynamic content.
    E-commerce, online banking, and streaming services grew massively.

5. Web 3.0 (Present & Future)
    Also called the Semantic Web and sometimes linked with Blockchain/Web3.
    Focus on:
    AI & Machine Learning → smarter search engines, personalized recommendations.
    Decentralization → blockchain, cryptocurrencies, NFTs.
    IoT integration → connecting devices.
    Immersive experiences → AR/VR and the Metaverse.

🌐 What is Routing?
    Routing is the process of finding the best path for data packets to travel across networks (from source to destination).
    Every device on the internet (like your phone, laptop, or a server) has an IP address. Routers are responsible for directing packets between these devices.

🛠 How Routing Works in the Internet
    Packet Creation
    Data is broken into packets.
    Each packet contains: Source IP, Destination IP, and Data.
    Routers Forward Packets
    A router checks the destination IP.
    It uses a routing table (a list of known networks and next hops) to decide where to send the packet.
    Multiple Hops
    A packet usually travels through multiple routers (called hops).
    Each hop brings it closer to the destination.
    Reaching the Destination
    Finally, the packet reaches the target device (like a web server).
    The server responds with packets that follow the reverse route (not always the exact same path).

🗺 Example: Sending a Message Across the Internet
    You type www.google.com.
    DNS finds Google’s IP address.
    Your packet leaves your device → goes to your home router → ISP router → regional routers → backbone routers → Google’s servers.
    Each router decides the best next hop using BGP/OSPF/etc.
    Response comes back, possibly along a different path.
